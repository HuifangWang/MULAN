MULAN: MULTIPLE CONNECTIVITY ANALYSIS

The MULAN (MULtiple connectivity ANalysis) MATLAB toolbox helps researchers to
evaluate connectivity analysis methods in a systematic way. Prior to applying
specific methods to a given dataset, MULAN can be used to generate relevant
simulated signals, identify valid parameter ranges for the methods, and
evaluate their performance and robustness against underlying connection
strengths, graph structures and noise levels. Lastly, new methods can easily be
added and tested using this toolbox. 


##MULAN setup

To begin using MULAN, just place the MULAN1 files in any accessible folder on
your computer and make sure to either set the MULAN1 folder as the current path
in MATLAB or add the folder containing MULAN1 to the MATLAB path.
